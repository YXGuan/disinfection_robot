# disinfection_robot

### Philosophy (leadership statement)
- Community engagement based engineering --> intensively focus on product and service
- Open source & open hardware --> a platform for anyone to learn about robotics and connect with people
- Be open to new ideas and critiques
- Design principle, simple , feasible 

### Disinfection Robot architechture
1. Communication (improving)
- WIFI+Bluetooth connection between raspberry pi and any mobile devices using NodeRed
- Serial communication between Pi and Arduino Uno

2. End effector ("achieved")
-  UV light
-  Sprayer

3. Navigation (focus)
- mostly rely on ultrasonic sensor for wall following/obstacle avoidance and infrard sensor for line following
- Simulation software: Webot ( Cyber Robotics)
